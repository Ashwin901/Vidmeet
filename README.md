## Introduction :

When the user opens the link there are two options either we can create a room or we can join a room.

If the user creates a room then the user is provided with a room id in the navbar, which he can share with others.
If a user wants to join a particular room he should gain a id from the other users who are already present in the room.

 ## Modules :
 
 1) After creating or joining a room the user is taken to the main screen where the user can chat after allowing the site to use the camera and microphone of the device.
 
 2) There are two options at the bottom of the screen : 1) stop video  2) mute
                  If a user presses the stop video button the other users will not be able to see that particular user's video.
                  A user can mute himself in the conversation by pressing the mute button
 
 3) Thre's also a leave button using which a user can leave the room
 
 4) At the end there is a chat button, if we press this button a chat section will appear where the users present in the room can text each other.
    The chat section can slide in and slide out by pressing the chat button
